#### Default Discord theme but transparent

* Make sure you are using the Dark appearance in Discord `User Settings -> Appearance`.

* The `--custom-theme-mix-amount-base` value can letting you tweak the transparency of the theme.

Use [Mica For Everyone](https://github.com/MicaForEveryone/MicaForEveryone) to achieve frosted glass look!

## How to Install?

* Make sure you have Vencord or BetterDiscord installed.
* Enable `Enable Window Transparency` in your Discord User Settings. Note that not every client are made the same, look around or search online to find where or how to enable it.
* Download the theme file from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EnderDragonEP/Transparent-Discord-Theme/main/Transparent.theme.css) (right click and click `Save link as...`).
* Put it in your theme folder. You can usually find the folder location from `Discord User Settings -> Themes -> Open Themes Folder`.
* Enable the theme from your Discord Themes settings and your Discord window should now be transparent.
* Install [Mica For Everyone](https://github.com/MicaForEveryone/MicaForEveryone/releases).
* Open Mica For Everyone and click the `+` button below, then select `Add Process Rule`.
* Type `Discord` in the `Process Name` input field, then hit the `Add` button.
* Select `Discord` on the left side of the Mica For Everyone application.
* Set the Titlebar Color to `Dark`, Backdrop Type to `Acrylic`, and Corner Mode to `Rounded`. Or you can change these options to whatever you like.
* Enable the `Extend Frame Into Client Area` and `Blur Behind` options.
* Minimize the Discord window and restore it to see if the effects are applied.
* Enjoy! :3
