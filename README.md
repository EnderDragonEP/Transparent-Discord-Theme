## Update Announcement

* **Feb 9, 2025** - **Discord has gone through a major update and the theme is now updated and added more user customizations! Downloding [new](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EnderDragonEP/Transparent-Discord-Theme/main/Transparent.theme.css) theme file is required!**
I'm still serving my compulsory military service, so bug fixes may be delayed. Feel free to submit an issue or reach out to me on Discord: [noobienoodle89](https://discordapp.com/users/209309988907253760)
* **Feb 12, 2025** - User reported that the transparent background did not work. A fix is on its way but may take some times.
* **Feb 15, 2025** - If window transparency is still not working after enabling the option in the respective patch, try reinstalling Discord and reapplying the patch to restore the background transparency effect.
